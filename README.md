Please open the [NSW_Housing_Finance_New_Loan_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/famigerate/NSW-Housing-Finance-New-Loan-Analysis/blob/9a290928216b98cb5aab1d5a05b34c6c5f11c94d/NSW_Housing_Finance_New_Loan_Analysis.ipynb) for the project.

What I learn:
- Excel sheet is bad for github. It enforces absolute path everytime it is saved. so it keeps putting my local path and refuse to just safe the absolute path. Relinking is needed and security is bad because of it
